# Coursesite Submission Filter for TA/Graders
Usage: python filter.py list_of_name directory_of_submissions

Example:

    python filter.py listOfName CSE-123-010-SP16-H1-123456
    
This script will then copy all the files in folder CSE-123-010-SP16-H1-123456 with the same name in listOfName to a folder named toGrade inside CSE-123-010-SP16-H1-123456

Hope this helps! Let me know if there's any issue.
