# Coursesite Submission Filter for TA/Graders
Usage: python filter.py list_of_name directory_of_submissions

Example:
    python filter.py listOfName CSE-241-010-SP16-H5-828995

    This script will copy all the files in folder CSE-241-010-SP16-H5-828995 with the same name in listOfName to a folder named toGrade inside CSE-241-010-SP16-H5-828995 

Hope this helps! Let me know if there's any issue.
